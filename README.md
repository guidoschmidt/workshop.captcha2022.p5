### Project Structure

- `public` will contain all images, which we will be using (it's like the `data`
  folder of processing sketches or the `bin/data/` folder of openFramework apps)
- `src` contains all of our source code, with the following sub-directories:
    - `index.html` is just a plain HTML page to have a simple space for listing
      all of our sketches.
    - `p5` contains a copy of the p5js library, as well as a not yet released ui
      library for p5js.
    - `tools` contains the `TexturedShape` class its shader code, which we will
      be using during the workshop.
    - `scss` contains a bit of CSS/SCSS to give the overall project a bit of
      styling.
    - `_template` contains a minimal template sketch, which you can copy and
      rename to start with your own sketch, e.g.
      ```bash
      cd src/
      cp _template landscapes
      ```
      To see the copied sketch folder in the overview, you need to edit
      `src/index.html`!
